# MVP Success Criteria (Revised)

## Core Deliverables
- ✅ Process 1 Physics textbook chapter successfully
- ✅ Generate 50+ learning objectives with Bloom's taxonomy classification
- ✅ Store results in database with proper relationships and traceability
- ✅ API endpoints functional with <1 second response time
- ✅ End-to-end pipeline completes without errors
- ✅ Docker deployment works locally with health checks
- ✅ Automated quality scoring achieves 80%+ average

## Quality Metrics
- **Coverage**: Complete TBAT Physics "Kinematics and Forces" topic coverage
- **Quality**: 80%+ average score on automated metrics (relevance, clarity, structure)
- **Performance**: <4 hours processing time for complete subject
- **Reliability**: 95%+ success rate for pipeline execution
- **Testability**: 60%+ code coverage with integration tests

## Post-MVP Roadmap
**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** Multi-subject support, advanced validation, TBAT question alignment  
**Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):** Multi-language optimization, human review interface, production monitoring  
**Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8):** Cross-exam support, analytics dashboard, performance optimization
