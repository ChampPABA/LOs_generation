# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
• Establish LO database covering TBAT Physics subject within 2-week delivery timeline (MVP scope reduction)
• Create robust RAG pipeline that transforms chapter-level content into structured, Bloom's taxonomy-aligned Learning Objectives
• Build scalable foundation system supporting future adaptive learning integration for personalized product recommendations
• Enable systematic, consistent LO generation replacing manual interpretation of broad blueprint topics
• Achieve 80%+ automated LO quality score using relevance and clarity metrics (revised from TBAT validation)

## Background Context

Thai university entrance exams (TBAT) provide only high-level content blueprints without granular Learning Objectives, creating critical gaps in exam question consistency and adaptive learning capabilities. Current blueprint topics like "Kinematics and forces" lack specific, measurable learning outcomes, forcing question writers to rely on personal interpretation. This inconsistency prevents systematic competency assessment and limits the existing profitable education business from offering data-driven personalized recommendations.

Phase 1 addresses this foundational gap by implementing a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that systematically processes standard educational textbooks (Physics focus for MVP) to generate detailed, exam-aligned Learning Objectives. The system uses simplified chunking strategy with basic retrieval and multi-language model support (English-first approach) to ensure comprehensive coverage and quality output.
