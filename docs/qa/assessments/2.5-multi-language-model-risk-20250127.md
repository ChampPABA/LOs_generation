- Create extensive test datasets with mixed-content scenarios
**Testing Focus**: Language detection accuracy tests, mixed-content processing validation

### 3. OPS-001: Model Loading and Initialization Failures
**Score: 9 (Critical)**

### 6. SEC-001: Model API Security
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Ollama local models may have security vulnerabilities
**Impact**: High - Could expose system to local privilege escalation or data access
**Mitigation**:
- Regular Ollama security updates and patch management
- Implement API access controls and rate limiting
- Monitor model API usage for anomalies

### 7. BUS-001: Thai Language Model Quality
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - bge-m3 may not perform optimally for specialized Thai educational terminology
**Impact**: High - Poor Thai content processing affects LO generation quality for Thai textbooks
**Mitigation**:
- Extensive validation against Thai educational content
- Consider fine-tuning or alternative Thai-specific models
- Implement quality scoring for Thai vs English processing

## Medium Risks

### 8. TECH-003: Model Version Compatibility

**Probability**: Medium - Model updates may break existing functionality
**Impact**: Medium - Requires system updates and potential data migration

### 9. PERF-002: Memory Usage with Multiple Models
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Running multiple embedding models simultaneously increases memory requirements
**Impact**: Medium - May require infrastructure scaling

### 10. DATA-002: Model-Specific Metadata Management
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Tracking which model was used for each embedding requires careful metadata management
**Impact**: Medium - Loss of traceability affects debugging and quality assessment

## Low Risks

### 11. OPS-002: Model Update Procedures
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Model updates are infrequent but require careful coordination
