# Story 2.4: Basic Retrieval System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** LO generation system,
**I want** a basic retrieval system that finds relevant content chunks using vector similarity,
**so that** I can provide contextual information for Learning Objective generation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vector similarity search implementation with configurable relevance thresholds
2. Query processing system for handling LO generation requests with context retrieval
3. Result ranking and filtering based on relevance scores and content quality
4. Integration with existing vector index and chunk metadata systems
5. Performance optimization ensuring sub-second retrieval for typical queries
6. Basic caching mechanism for frequently accessed content patterns
7. Error handling and fallback mechanisms for search failures
8. Integration tests validate retrieval accuracy and performance requirements

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement vector similarity search (AC: 1-3)
- [ ] Setup query processing pipeline (AC: 2, 4)
- [ ] Add result ranking and filtering (AC: 3, 6)
- [ ] Create performance optimization (AC: 5)
- [ ] Setup error handling (AC: 7)
- [ ] Create integration tests (AC: 8)

## Dev Notes

### Key Components
**Retrieval Pipeline (Source: requirements.md FR7, FR9):**
- Basic vector similarity search from Qdrant
- Query processing for educational content retrieval
- Result ranking with relevance and quality scoring
- Integration with chunk metadata for context enrichment
