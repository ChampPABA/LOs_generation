# Story 3.2: API Endpoints & Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** external system integrating with the LO Generation Pipeline,
**I want** RESTful API endpoints for triggering LO generation and monitoring job status,
**so that** I can integrate the system with existing educational platforms and workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. RESTful API endpoints implemented: /generate-los, /status/{job_id}, /health
2. Job processing system with unique job_id generation and status tracking
3. API authentication and authorization with basic API key validation
4. Request/response validation using Pydantic models for data consistency
5. Error handling with proper HTTP status codes and informative messages
6. API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger for testing and integration
7. Rate limiting and request throttling for system protection
8. Integration tests validate all endpoints and error scenarios

## Dev Notes
**API Integration (Source: requirements.md FR15, FR17):**
- FastAPI framework with OpenAPI documentation
- Job-based processing with async status tracking
- Basic authentication and rate limiting
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
