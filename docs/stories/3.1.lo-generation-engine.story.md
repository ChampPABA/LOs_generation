# Story 3.1: Learning Objective Generation Engine

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** educational content system,
**I want** a Learning Objective generation engine using Gemini API and Pydantic AI validation,
**so that** I can create structured, Bloom's taxonomy-aligned LOs from retrieved content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LO Generation service integrated with Gemini 2.5 Pro API for text generation
2. Pydantic AI validation ensuring structured LO output with required fields
3. Bloom's taxonomy classification integration for educational alignment
4. Quality scoring system for relevance, clarity, and structure validation
5. Integration with retrieval system for contextual content processing
6. Async generation processing using Celery for background LO creation
7. LO storage in PostgreSQL with complete traceability and version tracking
8. Integration tests validate generation quality and system performance

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Setup Gemini API integration (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement Pydantic AI validation (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add Bloom's taxonomy classification (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create quality scoring system (AC: 4)
- [ ] Integrate retrieval context (AC: 5)
- [ ] Setup async processing (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement LO storage (AC: 7)
- [ ] Create integration tests (AC: 8)

## Dev Notes

### Key Components
