# Story 4.1: System Testing & Deployment

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** comprehensive system testing and Docker deployment configuration,
**so that** I can deploy the LO Generation Pipeline reliably in production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. End-to-end integration tests validating complete pipeline: ingestion → retrieval → generation
2. Docker containerization with multi-service orchestration and environment configuration
3. Production deployment configuration with proper security and monitoring setup
4. Performance testing validating system requirements and load handling
5. Database migration and initialization scripts for production deployment
6. Health monitoring and alerting for critical system components
7. Backup and recovery procedures for data protection and system resilience
8. Documentation and runbooks for deployment and operational procedures

## Dev Notes
**Deployment Requirements (Source: requirements.md NFR1-NFR4):**
- Docker Compose for production orchestration
- Performance validation against NFR requirements
- Complete system integration testing
- Production monitoring and health checks
